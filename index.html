            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>At first my intentions had been to become law enforcement.
                After years of essentially interrupting my own progress with distractions in the form of women i eventually called it quits.
                Puzzles, proplem solving and quick resoloutions to problems have always been things i loved, and thats where programming was introduced.
                A childhood friend whom is in the currently in the industry let me take a gander at exactly what he does and i instantly fell inlove with it.
                Im great at a lot of things but programming is by far the toughest, yet i still love it.
